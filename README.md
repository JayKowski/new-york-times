## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project was gotten from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0" target="_blank" >New York Times Article page</a>. This project was really fun to build and at the same time quite challenging. In this project, there were quite a handful of aligned and positioned elements on the web page, and so our aim is to achieve them using the css float property only.
